I'm a cyber security major with a passion for learning and improving my abilities in programming, and even though I'm just a freshman, I still am skilled and have experience in many languages, including Python, Autohotkey, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, C++, Lua, PHP, Bash, Ruby, VBScript, and Powershell.
