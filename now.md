# Education
Currently I'm a freshman in college going for a degree in cybersecurity, taking 7 classes for a total of 18 credit hours. Because of my love for mathematics and computing, I'm taking calc 3 and considering going for a double major in mathematics and cybersecurity, with a minor in comp sci. Most of my other courses are just required courses for graduation, but for fun I'm also taking piano for non-majors, because I'm very passionate about music.

# Hobbies
I have a lot of hobbies that I'm very interested in, and recently I've been spending a lot of time slacklining. I love being in water, and was a competetive swimmer and diver back in high school. I play a lot of video games too, and have recently started playing League of Legends.

# Music
Music is a big part of my life, and I was a bass clarinetist for eight years. I don't own a bass clarinet, so recently I've been learning piano, and I also occasionally play flute or guitar.

# Investing
When I have downtime, I try to spend my time researching and learning about investment strategies in the hopes that I'll be able to build up a nice retirement account for myself. I've been watching a lot of [CottonCandyTA](https://youtube.com/c/c0tt0nc4ndyTA) recently for technical analysis, for both stocks and cryptocurrency.
