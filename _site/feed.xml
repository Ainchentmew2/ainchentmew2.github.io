&lt;h1 id=&quot;hcktivitycon-ctf&quot;&gt;H@cktivitycon CTF&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before now, I’ve had no experience in anything involving Cybersecurity, but when I heard about the CTF run by John Hammond, congon4tor, M_alpha, fumenoid, NightWolf, Blacknote, and CalebStewart, I figured it’d be a great learning experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent several hours researching and learning, in hopes of building up my abilities before the CTF. When it came time to start, I felt like I’d be a little useless and not have much to bring to the team, but it turned out that I actually solved seven challenges, netting  me just over 1100 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’m going to be detailing my thought process and how I found each flag, based on the order I completed them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tsunami&quot;&gt;Tsunami&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;description-woah-its-a-natural-disaster-but-something-doesnt-seem-so-natural-about-this-big-wave&quot;&gt;Description: “Woah! It’s a natural disaster! But something doesn’t seem so natural about this big wave…&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody on my team seemed interested in trying this one, as it involved an audio file and none of us had headphones.
Checking the file type, I found that “tsunami” was a .wav file, so I renamed it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Ainchentmew2/ainchentmew2.github.io/images/tsunami2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured maybe there was something hidden in the visualization in the wave itself, so I downloaded it and opened it in sonic visualiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Ainchentmew2/ainchentmew2.github.io/images/tsunami3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t find anything right away, but I looked at the spectrogram view and zoomed in a little towards the end, and the flag was right there in plaintext!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Ainchentmew2/ainchentmew2.github.io/images/tsunami4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bass-64&quot;&gt;Bass 64&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;description-it-uh-looks-like-someone-bass-boosted-this-can-you-make-any-sense-of-it&quot;&gt;Description: “It, uh… looks like someone bass-boosted this? Can you make any sense of it?”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downloading this file resulted in an ASCII text file with every letter represented as ASCII art. Based on the name and the hint, I assumed that it was encoded in base 64. Sure enough, I copied down the letters into a base 64 decoder, and got the flag!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;target-practice&quot;&gt;Target Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;description-can-you-hit-a-moving-target&quot;&gt;Description: “Can you hit a moving target?”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one was a gif that looked a little like a target with vibrating dots on the outside of the target. I split apart the frames of the gif, and noticed that frame 16 looked a little odd compared to the rest, based on the top left corner sticking out. I wondered what I could do with the image, and realized it looked a little like a QR code. Upon searching for circular QR codes, I found out that the image was actually a Maxi code, and scanning it gave the flag!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;butter-overflow&quot;&gt;Butter Overflow&lt;/h2&gt;
